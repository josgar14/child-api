# child-api
Manning Book Angular 7, Chapter 8 exercise,

Here we practice with child-parent component communication, we use ViewChild, ViewChildren, and a plus life cycle hook ngAfterViewInit(), here I learned that Frameworks and libraries take the liberty to change the code and we as developers have the responsibility to research those changes an example of that in this code is that on angular 8 they changed the ViewChild and now you have to pass the following parameter { static: true } if you don't you guessed ðŸ˜’ you get a tremendous red error in your console ðŸ’€. I know is a little difficult  every time they do a change in a programming language and errors come up, is overwhelming and stressful, thanks god that the programming presence online is amazing and helpful and you can find solution to these problems online most of the times, stack overflow and every programming blog on the internet.

THANK YOU! ðŸ’–
